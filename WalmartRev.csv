The service to me was terrible. They kept telling me will refund me, but till tonight, I still get nothing. And instead, I received an email that they did not get the returned items... which is not my problem, the Walmart store should be responsible for these items. But I never get refund after I returned.

7,"The store located in Hallandale on Hallandale Beach Blvd near S Ocean Drive is the worst customer experienced. I travelled from Miami to this location to pick up a few cans of spray paint. I waited for over 30 minutes asking employees for the key to the spray paint cabinet and no one could help. Then finally she said she was a manager and went to go look for the key, 10 minutes later she said the guy who has the keys took them home last night and they could not open the cabinet. I wasted time and money coming here and could not buy the paint. This is not the 1st time I had problems with this location, They have a customer service box and I press the button for service many, many times and NO ONE comes. What's the point of this box? Why can't you have more than 1 key for the paint cabinets. Why do you lock them if no one can open them?

As for walmart.com anyone you talk to is offshore and they will not transfer you to USA rep. nor can you reach corporate Walmart. I ordered several things online and not only did they not arrive, I have the USPS tracking code which states they never got the pkg but a label was printed. Now when I look at my account order it states it was delivered but I have proof it was not. Fraudulent company F&N Mart never sent the product but charged my card. Customer service after hours on the phone with them and by email was the worst ever. I hate Amazon but at least your delivery gets here, USPS and Fed Ex and UPS stand behind you, walmart.com does not...and corporate doesn't want to talk to you either. I wonder why?

Some still weren't acceptable AND others couldn't be reproduced because the order had already expired in their system. I was advised to cancel the entire order and get my money back.

12,"My wife and I recently did a large grocery shopping at the Delafield Walmart. Now the store has recently been reset with new shelves which is nice. Sadly when we were there most of those shelves were empty. At the conclusion of our shopping we wanted to check out and discovered only one person at the check out and a ton of new self check out stations. Now I have used these stations in the past when I have a few items and they are fast and efficient; however if you have a cart full of groceries there is no place to go with the checked items. I was going to get a second cart, but then I remembered ALL of the carts were in the parking lot. That is in fact where we got ours to begin this adventure. So here I am scanning products, putting them in those ** thin bags and setting those bags on the floor. Are you kidding me!!!! Never again will I shop at Walmart.

I'm not at all happy and if there was any way possible for me to post pictures of this I would and will be all over the place.

15,Went on Walmart website looking for a PS5. I know it was a long shot but thought I should give it a try. Walmart advertised they would have some available but you had to sign up for Walmart+ to be eligible. Signed up & paid & waited for the time they said it would be available. At the exact moment they said they would be available a window came on saying they were sold out and gave a timer counting down when you could add it to your cart which started at 21 minutes. My sister in another time zone was 4 minutes ahead of mine which is strange since we got the initial message at the same time.

All with excuses if you can actually get in touch with them. Forget in person agencies they are useless and just one more reason not to use. Walmart they are crooks and frauds. A money order should be able to be replaced at the agency you got but at since so many identity checks are in place with not additional fee just like USPS would do. I have the original money order tab and receipt. But no. 2 days many phone calls they want me to pay over a 100 and wait weeks to get a replacement.

Many words later told me she would have delivered by 5, 5:30 rolled around, another round of 30 minutes to get a human and hung up on. Finally a person at pick up said my items were picked up- but you see, I never received those too. I asked if it was the same thief, she said probably.

They told me they can't refund me the $250, nor can they send me cards I will be able to activate. At this point I have paid money for cards that don't work with no timetable for resolution.

They kept giving different reasons for canceling my order and I would constantly have to argue about a new promo code. I feel it is owed to me and should be honored. The third time they canceled my order when I used the promo code, they said the item was out of stock. But for some reason they did not want to give me a new promo code and said they are only good for one time use. I’ve tried on four different occasions and have not been able to use it the one time.

I explained to her that first, there is no indication in the receipt that the item is “marketplace” item. Second, the instruction says to return the item, I need to print the email and return it to Walmart store. In addition, that item was the only item on that receipt.

I will check website for a product and see it's either in stock or limited quantity available. Yet when I arrive at this location 10 minutes later after checking website there are no items on shelves. Funny thing is I can order online for free same day pick up at store and the item is available. How is that? I believe you are purposely not stocking shelves so people order online and when doing that there is a minimum purchase amount that people have to spend in order to pick up item in store. That's ridiculous and for these reasons I will NOT be frequenting your store anymore nor order online from Walmart.

793,When shopping one day I was purchasing a packet of printer paper. I put it in my cart and on the way out of the aisle I noticed in the center main aisle there was a bin with a sale price for the same printer paper I had in my cart. So I checked the price at the check pricing machine and it didn't show with the sale price. I notified a clerk who said to tell them at the check out line. My complaint is that this is the 4th time that Walmart shows a sale price on the item yet when you check out it doesn't show up at the register with the sale price. I feel they are doing this on purpose to make the consumer think they are getting something at the sale price. They never correct the pricing in their computer so if a consumer isn't alert to this switch then they are being charged without the sale price.,2," March 13, 2015","Stockton, NJ",Stockton, NJ,Walmart

Well, I wanted the mollies but you can't find a price so what am I to do? She said, ""Thank you, have a nice night,"" and walked away. I do not see the reasoning behind having fish tanks if they are not going to be taken care of. Why not sell them like Crossett, AR did and be done with it. By the way, this store is in Bastrop, LA. I drive 35 miles to trade with Bastrop because of the fish, and to be treated so nonchalantly and to see the shape of the tanks was a disgrace. What do you do with your tanks?

Wal-Mart did charge my credit card $250. They said they have no ""eta"" for when the issue will be resolved. They told me they can't refund me the $250, nor can they send me cards I will be able to activate. At this point I have paid money for cards that don't work with no timetable for resolution. I think after 30 days, Wal-Mart should refund me my money and once they figure things out, just don't activate the worthless cards they sent me.

1823,All in all my experience with my local Walmart Supercenter has been positive. The produce is fresh and lower priced than other grocery stores I've shopped. I have found the meat department to have a good variety of quality meat at lower prices. The problem with customer service is being able to find an employee to help you. Once you find one they are very knowledgeable of product locations and walk you directly to it. The number of available checkout lanes to check out are usually 50% less than what is needed. It's not uncommon to be waiting fifteen minutes or more to get checked out. This tends to make the grocery shopping trip an unwelcome chore.,4," Jan. 12, 2017","Wausau, WI",Wausau, WI,Walmart

No difference, in one ear out the other. I complained to the managers, same thing no difference, same amount of dead fish and ignorance to something that only takes a few minutes to do.

You get what you pay for. If a person aspires for individualized attention, then they should go to a boutique store, where they will pay obscene prices for overvalued merchandise. Why pay over one hundred dollars for a pair of jeans when you can buy the same at Walmart for $19.97? No one will notice unless you bring it to their attention. The same philosophy holds true for all the departments. My being able to retire at a comparatively young age is partly due to the amazing value I receive at Walmart. Some of us do not care if something is locally sourced, free trade, sustainable, etc. We just want the best value for the money. I do not care if the item is made in China, Bangladesh, or Equador.

My complaint is that I was passed over for promotion to jewelry department manager in favor of a floor associate in the asset protection department. This associate has no prior experience in jewelry.

2240,"I was a regular shopper at the Walmart located at the Southside Dothan, AL until it reached to a point that I was being treated as a criminal without cause.  I noticed over the last month that I was being watched by Walmart's undercover security, even to the point that other customers would be watching and looking at who they were investigating.  At times, I would even be followed out of the store to the parking lot but never confronted.  I have given them no reason to treat me this way, nor do I have any history or charges on my record for such a crime.  I reached the point of not wanting anyone to go to Walmart with me in fear that they might be linked to me and also be treated as I was being treated.",5," Sept. 29, 2011","Dothan, AL",Dothan, AL,Walmart
2241,"I was at Walmart with my wife and 3 years old son for shopping on 09/26/2011, around 8:30PM to 9:12PM. I wanted to buy a watch for myself. The lady who was behind the counter of the watch section, her name was Tyisa, I asked her to see some watches. The way she talked to me was very unprofessional. She was very rude. When I tried to let her understand that this is not the way to talk to the customer, she was more rude. I walked away from there without buying a watch.

2243,"My complaint is based on a long-term experience.  When I think I know where to find what I need, you move it.  The stock in your stores is constantly on the move.  It is very irritating to continuously have to look for what you need.  I have rheumatoid arthritis, and I have mobility problems.  I don't want to spend extra 30 minutes in Wal-Mart looking for things that have moved since the last visit.  My goodness!",5," Sept. 14, 2011","Las Cruces, NM",Las Cruces, NM,Walmart

I have waited up to twenty minutes in line to get waited on with no help and end up walking away each time.

2247,"Maybe the reason for the glut of these hi-def TVs is consumers remember last year the TV only lasted just before the so called warranty and nobody would help they all passed the buck back and forth. Furthermore, you shouldn't buy high end electronics at Wal-Mart. They Wal-Mart tell the manufacturers to make a set just so they can sell it at a ""cheap"" price. Let the buyer beware. Many justified upset consumers with no recourse and hope they shy away from Wal-Mart. Let them sell them at ""pocket change"" prices. That way when they go bad, toss them out.

2248,"I've been hearing many stories about their electronics and other items. People don't realize that Wal-mart drives a very hard bargain with suppliers and manufactures so they can sell things at a very low cost. They say guaranteed for a year; well, that's about all you'll get, maybe 13 months. People don't realize from the manufacturer to the shipper and employees of  Wal-mart and bottom line is for profit at Wal-mart. Everybody takes a piece of that purchase price the consumer pays and what happens is ""quality suffers"". People throw caution to the four winds have to go and get one of those ""deals"".",5," Aug. 5, 2010","Beecher, IL",Beecher, IL,Walmart
