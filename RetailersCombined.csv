0,I I bought two pillowcase bed sham from Bed Bath & Beyond. When I took the them out of the package has the colors are slightly off. I tried to return one of them just for a simple exchange to try to get to that simply matched. The manager of the store is incompetent idiot - Burlington Massachusetts. Don't waste your time going there if you have any problems whatsoever and a lot of their products are just plain crap. Thank you.,1,"Newton, MA",Newton, MA,Bed Bath and Beyond,2022-01-08
1,"They cancelled my Christmas order so my gift never arrived. No explanation given. Spent 20 minutes on phone with customer service, who committed to calling me back after finding out why the manager cancelled my order. Never heard anything. They have no customer service and they do not value the business of their customers. In doing this review, discovered there are many, many complaints. I choose not to give my money to disrespectful companies that could care less about doing their jobs and addressing customer concerns.",1,"Penn Valley, CA",Penn Valley, CA,Bed Bath and Beyond,2022-01-04
2,"When I placed a order for a electric blanket on 12-19-21 my only shipping option was standard ground. On 12-20 BBB notified FedEx that my package was ready to pick up. On 12-23 FedEx finally picked up my package in Texas and I was given a delivery date of 12-26. Well... on 12-27 FedEx finally left Texas with my package and on its way to GJ Colorado. On 12-28 I was notified of a scan in Henderson CO and then finally received a new delivery date.... on 01-04-22!!! BBB really needs to give customers more shipping options and they need to find a better shipping company than FedEx, like UPS, DSL and USPS!",1,"Fruita, CO",Fruita, CO,Bed Bath and Beyond,2021-12-28
3,Two orders did not arrive…although their customer service said that they were delivered. Three hours to contact customer service..and then was promised delivery. Still not received. I was promised same day delivery. Should say: NO DAY DELIVERY. They have my money. I have no product. The thought of trying to contact customer service again is a hopeless thought. I really do not know how to have anyone solve this. How can a business be run like this with no concern for the customer whatsoever. They make it as difficult as possible to reach customer service. I can't even ask for a refund since I cannot get the products delivered. Money and hours wasted!! Shame on BBB!! Never put faith in BBB to come through honestly.,1,"Larkspur, CA",Larkspur, CA,Bed Bath and Beyond,2021-12-20
4,"WORST customer service ever!! Can't reach anyone & they have $111.00 of my money for a package FedEx supposedly delivered to a wrong address, almost 2 wks ago. I can not reach them to even give them the case # to have my money refunded. I have called over & over, used the virtual chat, called the location it came from, and nothing. My time has been wasted over & over. ",1,"North Hollywood, CA",North Hollywood, CA,Bed Bath and Beyond,2021-12-07
5,"I order and shop in store a TON. I started doing same day delivery a few months ago. A few weeks ago ordered OXO containers, they came scratched from being just thrown in the bag. Last week ordered a Ninja knife set and when it was dropped off the box was not sealed and only the knife block was in the box. I’ve contacted Bed Bath and Beyond over 4 times about this with zero resolution. Told 2-3 days and still nothing. I offered to return the block with a label. I was told to either drop it off at the store or discard the block. Also, I’ve requested a receipt from a few months ago to make a return and still no receipt. No communication except call center employees giving us false information.",1,"Tarpon Springs, FL",Tarpon Springs, FL,Bed Bath and Beyond,2021-12-06
6,I ordered a bed for my grandson on November 4th and it is now December 1st and bed still has not arrived in full. Have written emails have called and still not gotten any help. They ask for the part that we have not received and I sent them a picture and they said oh you didn't send it so we can't resolve this. So I sent it again and wrote them and told them that I have proof,1,"Newnan, GA",Newnan, GA,Bed Bath and Beyond,2021-12-01
7,"I have experienced this problem multiple times with Bed Bath & Beyond, and have expressed my frustration to them each time -- but nothing changes. When I return an item, I expect my refund in 1 - 2 days. Every other retailer -- Walmart, Target, CVS, Home Depot, etc. -- refunds my money back into my bank or onto my credit card in 1 - 2 days. Not BB&B. Three to five days, or even longer. They have their item back AND they still have my money. This is not standard practice for the industry. Shame on you, BB&B.",1,"Santa Cruz, CA",Santa Cruz, CA,Bed Bath and Beyond,2021-11-18
8,"Bed Bath & Beyond has delayed my shipping twice. When I spoke with the customer representative for the first time, it was suggested the best way to get my order on the day I need was to cancel my current order and place a new one to pick it up at a store near me. I placed a new order to pick it up at a store; however, my original order was never canceled. I received a second email saying my original order is being delayed. I called Bed Bath & Beyond which the representative says this time the order can only be canceled after 30 minutes of placing it. It is unacceptable that a store the size of Bed Bath & Beyond does not have a better system in place. If my item has never been shipped it should be an easy fix for them to do.

9,"When I think about the thousands and thousands of $$$ I spent in their local store over the years... now with the pandemic and having become elderly and ill, all purchases are online. Well, I purchased a set of Oxo bowls which were featured in their catalog. When I took them out of the box, they were much too heavy for me. Put them right back in the box, taped it up and my son took to the UPS/FedEx store for immediate return -- UNUSED. Their policy is refund to the original method of payment, which is my BB&B charge account. Lo and behold, I received a merchandise gift card for $68 in the mail from them.

11,"I ordered a vacuum $200. They delivered it to the wrong address. My neighbour's. I went outside right away when I received their tracking **. It was delivered. I gave 1 star 5 times. No vacuum outside. No package outside. I asked my neighbour if they received a package and they said no way. They would have given it to me. They know my name. I called Bed Bath and Beyond and they gave me the run around and said, ""Go ask your neighbours."" I did. I also sent emails asking for a signature or a picture of the package outside the door they delivered it to. Guess what? Because of Covid they have neither!!! I am out $200 and a vacuum. I work retail also and we do not treat customers this way at all. Thanks for nothing bed bath and beyond. I will never ever go into the store again. Their reviews are all right so BUYER BEWARE when you shop here.",1,"Mississauga, Other",Mississauga, Other,Bed Bath and Beyond,2021-08-21
12,"I first tried to order some champagne glasses. They appeared to be in stock, until I put them in the cart. I signed up to get a back in stock notification on Aug. 6th. I did receive one on Aug. 17th. I ordered the glasses and used my 20% off coupon that I get all time. My delivery was between 8/24 - 8/25. On 8/18 I get a notification that my delivery was running behind and the new date was 8/25 - 8/26. Today on 8/20 I get a notification ""Unfortunately we're not able to fulfill part of your order"" and they canceled my order. This is really annoying as I was expecting these glasses for a party. I guess I will go ahead and buy them from another website, which I was going to in the first place. This is not the first time I've had this type of problem with BB&B.",1,"Palm Springs, CA",Palm Springs, CA,Bed Bath and Beyond,2021-08-20
13,"I ordered a onesie for my grandson. A couple of days later I received a notification that it had been shipped. Two days later, it still showed that it had not been sent to a carrier so I called them. They told me it was out of stock and they would refund my money. Why in the world would they tell me something shipped when they didn't actually have it in stock? That's unethical and should be illegal. It seems like every time I try to orders something, I get an out of stock when I go to checkout. While I understand there are shortages due to COVID, be honest about it and tell me it's out of stock before I put it in my cart.",1,"Annandale, VA",Annandale, VA,Bed Bath and Beyond,2021-08-01
14,"The last few online orders I placed with BBB have been a disaster. Defective merchandise arrives that never should have passed quality control, packages arrive late or not at all, etc. This company used to have much higher standards; now I think you can get better service from a vending machine. SHAME ON THEM!",1,"Boca Raton, FL",Boca Raton, FL,Bed Bath and Beyond,2021-07-22
15,"Ordered item 6/19/21. Bed Bath tracking says it's in my town on 6/21. 7/1, not yet delivered. USPS tracking says pkg in Atlanta waiting pickup. Cust service: oops, must be lost. Re-ordered 7/1. It's 7/8, again USPS says pkg in Atlanta waiting pickup. Soooo messed up! Cust serv is gushy-sweet, but can't tell me where, why, how, when.

16,"As a person with a pre existing disease I try to limit my outside interactions, thus I needed a new tooth brush. I place the order online and wanted it to ship to me. The latest possible time of arrival was suppose to be the 26th (today). My order has not even been sent out yet as of today. I do a chat with them to see what is the issue. Their excuse was their shipper is having issues and is backed up. So you knew this as a company but yet still allowed me to order without any warnings. Nor did you reach out just as basic humans to inform me they are having shipping issues. They just took my money and basically did not care if I get my order or not... Their attitude was nonchalant. So I asked, ""Why can’t you just set me up to pick up my items at my local store."" Their reply was they can not change an order delivery method once it has been complete. But how can it be complete when it’s never left the warehouse. But again they act like it’s just my problem. ",1,"Fayetteville, NC",Fayetteville, NC,Bed Bath and Beyond,2021-04-27
17,"Item was ordered on April 2nd, Received email on April 3rd that package had shipped, however, according to tracking, package did not ship until April 12th. When the package had failed to ship by April 10th, I attempted to cancel order but was told I could not because the order was complete. I spoke to customer service twice, once on April 9th and again on April 10th. I was told both times that the package was ""guaranteed"" to arrive on April 12th. It did not arrive until April 16th.  Customer service people obviously spoke English as a second language and were entirely unsympathetic and unhelpful.

18,"We bought a 14-piece set of Rachael Ray Hard Enamel Nonstick Aluminum Cookware and the stockpot was defective. The lid won't seal because the pot was misshapen when it was shipped to us. We contacted customer service when we noticed this defect and were offered a $15 credit for a pot that costs $39. We just wanted them to send us a new stockpot but customer service wouldn't answer our emails. We even sent pictures of the defect and still no answer. So we finally went to the store (120 miles away) to speak to them and the only way we could get a new stockpot was to return the WHOLE set.

23,This company must be in deep trouble. I have purchased in stores and online for years and never had issues until the past year. Orders always have missing and/or cancelled items. Customer service is polite but very slow and seems unable to assist. Delivery of orders takes forever and is sometimes sent to a wrong address (one I never entered). Not worth the hassle! I will no longer purchase from them.,1,"Baton Rouge, LA",Baton Rouge, LA,Bed Bath and Beyond,2021-01-30
24,I stopped into BB&B today (I have mobility issues) and I needed to be directed to the one item I was seeking. At the entrance at CUSTOMER SERVICE I asked a fellow for directions. He said he didn't know where it was. He summoned someone who eventually showed up (about 5 minutes later) who also didn't know. Said he had to look it up on the computer. After a painful 12 minutes or so I learned you didn't have what I was looking for. That is my last trip to your store (located so conveniently to me I might add). Atrocious lack of service. Signed disgusted.,1,"Victoria, BC",Victoria, BC,Bed Bath and Beyond,2021-01-25
25,"I've done business with BB&B for many years purchasing items for myself and for wedding & shower gifts. I am appalled that the company has chosen to become part of the cancel culture and refusing to carry Mr. Lindell's products. This decision is reprehensible and not the way Americans do business. I realize my personal decision to no longer patronize BB&B means little to them which is reflective of their new cancel culture business practice. However, I will encourage everyone I know to cancel BB&B and discontinue shopping there.",1,"Goose Creek, SC",Goose Creek, SC,Bed Bath and Beyond,2021-01-23

When I called to inquire as to delivery date, I was told it had shipped and it would arrive the next day. When I told the agent that I was looking at the tracking and it had not even left the warehouse, it was just silence. I demanded a refund.

However, since recently after they decided to remove My Pillows products from their stores, I realized that I am not supporting this company with spending one more dine in their store! They illustrated pure bigotry by cutting this American manufacturing company out solely because of differences in political views. The products that I have purchased lately have been low quality so I was teetering on ordering from them anyways. But now this bigotry was the final straw. Goodbye!

Got case number and expecting it in 5-7 business days. Case number ** still unresolved. Believe it or not the thing shows up a week later. No communication from BBB related to case, I have an Instant Pot I don’t need as I bought a new one from Target on Xmas Eve. Will be dropping my BBB+ membership at end of year and giving my business to Target. Lack of internal business support services and poor customer service communication. Lesson learned.

From 12/16 until today 12/25, my package is still in transit. I chatted with an online specialist yesterday (Pauline was the name).

I was told to contact FedEx for details. 1 week later it was delivered to my actual address. I decided I didn’t like the duvet and followed the online steps to initiate the return and dropped it off at an approved FedEx location. The next day FedEx indicated it was received. 2 weeks passed with no refund of $135 to my credit card.

Nothing had been delivered. When I finally found a phone number to call, the woman taking the call was pleasant, she explained that the item has not been in stock since last February. (What triggered the emails?) She said BB&B is having problems with their system. I would get a refund in three weeks.

I purchased everything from drapes, bedding, candles, kitchenware, etc. Due to a move to a remote area, it’s been over 5 years since I’ve made a purchase through them. I decided this year to purchase an artificial Christmas tree. It’s been rough on everyone, and I’m no exception. Even though it was a big expense, I bought an almost $200 tree. I ordered it on November 22, figuring that was plenty of time to get a tree, decorate it and brighten the Covid Christmas blues. I received an email on November 24 stating that it had been shipped.

Waited like a month and placed another order, which I was also told was lost. I am DONE and asked to discontinue and be refunded the membership all things considered.

They have no information on the remaining four items that are still ""processing"". What a joke! No wonder they are losing so much business to Amazon. I tried to use their chat system (which is apparently automated) and the cut and paste reply was ""orders placed on or before December 6 should appear in the tracking system.

Also, my breath was taken away in a bad way due to the over perfume smell walking in the door. I gagged in my face mask. Nonetheless, I needed the item I came in for. Before I get around the corner of the odd lay out of the store, there was a woman not wearing a face mask. There is a mandate in Shelby county that states businesses must require customers to wear facemask. Which shows that this company does not follow county mandates. When walking around the store there were several pairs of employees just standing around chatting, and I seen the employees look at this customer not wearing a mask, but did not say anything to her.

Search for something and get results that have nothing to do with what you are looking for. Search with different key words and it gets more aggravating and more irrelevant. Then, if you do find things you'd like, there is a guessing game on shipping costs. Some items qualify for free shipping and some don't. Listen Target, most shoppers don't have time to play ""does it or doesn't it qualify for free shipping games"". I can understand why Amazon is so successful online, like the company or not. It's a very simple process without wasting time. If Target would put as much emphasis on making their business more convenient for the public rather than more convenient for Target then maybe their online sales would should increases like Amazon's does.

Upon needing to have a new bank card issued, I went to Target and wrote a check, to which it was declined even though there was enough money in the account to cover the purchase 100's of times over.

Also none of them were styled for business casual/professional, they were just work belts. On top of that they literally had no plain white button down shirts. At all!

And I know it is Target, a department store so I didn't go in with super high expectations, but seriously there were maybe MAYBE 10 different belts. Also none of them were styled for business casual/professional, they were just work belts. On top of that they literally had no plain white button down shirts. At all! They had the fashionable (or what they consider fashionable) but no neutral, plain, ordinary white button downs.

Which was a simple $40 desk lamp. The pop up is automatically set to ""yes, protect me"" - you can't click the X - as I thought as I was charged for the plan. In the Order Detail on my account, it said it's non-refundable. It took a phone call and a nice customer service person to refund me the money charged for the plan. Which is why I give Target.com 3 stars vs. 1. Someone in their Marketing Department needs to be fired for conducting business this way.

I called Walmart for 30 min before a human picked up. Finally got pick-up and told her the driver lied, did not deliver and she said the groceries were still at the store. Many words later told me she would have delivered by 5, 5:30 rolled around, another round of 30 minutes to get a human and hung up on. Finally a person at pick up said my items were picked up- but you see, I never received those too. I asked if it was the same thief, she said probably. So, they let the kid pick up again and not instantly fired- WOW. He stole from me and lied twice. ",1,"Riverton, UT",Riverton, UT,Walmart,2021-11-08

The last delivery date I called Walmart and they said the product had been returned to them damaged so the shipping company was lying about the delivery and wasting my time and money. I asked for a replacement from Walmart and was told they could not provide one but suggested one that was over twice the price. What a scam.

I contacted so called customer service 3 times within the 15 day preparing your order time frame only to be guaranteed that the order will ship for it to be ultimately canceled. I have screenshots of our conversations. So no, they didn’t check with the warehouse like they said they did. They just flat out lied.
