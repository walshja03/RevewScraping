1,"Target refused to explain why my gift card not working. I already went to Target store to retrieve video clip showing that I checked balance before shopping, I had $100 balance in my card at AM10:17. But at AM10:35, this card cannot be used when I check out. Even Target store manager/security can provide such proof, I still cannot get the balance back and Target cannot explain where the gift card balance went.

2,I decided to try shopping Target online because I couldn't find the Akedo mystery pack anywhere else. The reason for buying these are to find rare action figures. You don't know which character you are getting until you open the package. One of the characters are very rare and worth a lot of money. I ordered 10 packages the first time and over half had been opened. I was very disappointed but decided to give them another opportunity. The next time I ordered 20 Akedo mystery packs and when I received them every one of them had been pre opened. They had to have been shipped that way from Target because they were in sealed Target boxes. I probably shouldn't have ordered a second time. That was my mistake. There will not be a third.,1," Jan. 6, 2022","Paris, TX",Paris, TX
3,TARGET lost the card and trying to get a replacement has been a nightmare. I have been disconnected (hung up on) 17 times. You cannot understand what they are saying because of broken English. I am still waiting for the replacement card that I ordered back in November. Very rude and hard to understand. My poor granddaughter still has not received her Christmas gift.

8,"This is one of several visits I have made to Target's app to try and make a purchase. Firstly, search results leave a lot to be desired. Search for something and get results that have nothing to do with what you are looking for. Search with different key words and it gets more aggravating and more irrelevant. Then, if you do find things you'd like, there is a guessing game on shipping costs. Some items qualify for free shipping and some don't. Listen Target, most shoppers don't have time to play ""does it or doesn't it qualify for free shipping games"". I can understand why Amazon is so successful online, like the company or not. It's a very simple process without wasting time. If Target would put as much emphasis on making their business more convenient for the public rather than more convenient for Target then maybe their online sales would should increases like Amazon's does. TO the CEO, worry more about improving online customer service than forcing divisive cultural issues down the public's throat!!",1," Oct. 10, 2021","Pueblo, CO",Pueblo, CO

They put $75 back in Store Merchandise Credit and $15 on my credit card! WHY? I spent $125 on my credit card, so ALL of the $90 should go back on my credit card. I spent more than enough to ""eat up"" my store credit. WHY??? You are controlling your customer by FORCING them come back into your store.

I called Customer Service on 06-28-21 to see if I could get my order shipped quicker, and was told that the request was sent, and I would receive an e-mail with an update if my request was approved. No e-mail sent. On 07-01-21 I called again to Customer Service to Cancel my order entirely and was told I could not cancel my order because it was not processed yet. What a Line of Bull. Wouldn't it make more sense to cancel my order before it is process to ship? I was told that when I receive a message that my order has shipped, then I could cancel my order. This is a backwards policy. It cost the company money for labor and material to process an order and get it shipped, when it doesn't cost anything to just cancel the order.

13,"As someone who designed Targets, I can promise they care as little about the customers as humanly possible. They purposefully design their stores so you get lost, have hard times locating what you want, and force you to spend as much time as possible in the store. This leads into the reason I will never shop at a single Target again in my lifetime. Upon needing to have a new bank card issued, I went to Target and wrote a check, to which it was declined even though there was enough money in the account to cover the purchase 100's of times over. Why was it declined? Well, because in order to write a check to Target, you must first have a good history of writing good checks. ",1," June 23, 2021","Minneapolis, MN",Minneapolis, MN

15,"Target is the prime example of corporate America. You would think all of their items are made of gold, diamonds and silk by the way they price their items. More people will almost always pick Walmart over target due to the fact that Target is a uppity type of place to be in and it's uncomfortable as a minority to even walk through those doors like we don't belong there unless we work there for a regular paycheck.

I ordered items at the drive up and when I got there I realized I had no room in my trunk for the items so I asked the rep if they can kindly put it in the front seat since there was no room in the back. The rep got very agitated. Opened the door. Put the items in and slammed the door shut and stormed off. Extremely uncalled for and very rude.

17,"The Target in St. John, Indiana is not consistent on enforcing their mask policy. I've have seen so many people with either no mask or a mask on their chin. No one says anything to them and they are left alone to shop. My husband went to visit the store to grab milk and was asked to leave if he didn't wear a mask. He has no problem wearing a mask, but was very surprised they asked him to leave. He even called me and said, ""I thought you said the mask mandate is not followed here at this store, that no one is wearing them."" I told him that's true. I visit that store twice a week and wish I took pictures of the amount of people not wearing a mask, mostly women. I've only seen one man with no mask. I guess women are allowed to shop at Target with NO MASK, but men are required to wear a mask to shop. What's up with the discrimination at this location?",1," April 8, 2021","Dyer, IN",Dyer, IN

I was not asked if this was a documented service animal. My dog is harnessed, collared and leashed. I asked guest services for a copy of this policy.

The asset manager, who had finally asked me if I was being scammed, to whom I had replied ""I don't think so!"" was finally able to get through my trance, for lack of a better word. For one hour and fifteen minutes I entered and exited the store and was witnessed by the same clerk near the same self-checkout counters purchasing up to ten gift cards separately. Shortly after the conclusion of a terrifying four-hour experience, we were present at the Target store with a deputy sheriff.

In fact I have never stepped into a Walmart over the last 20 years. With that said this will be the end of my relationship with the Target corporation after the way I was treated. I placed an online order today for some Apple goods and they were cancelled because I used a gift card. I called and they apologized and said it was their mistake and they would get the order replaced.

In our state we have a price accuracy law. This means that if a price at the time of purchase isn't accurate to the price advertised, then if it's under 10 dollars, it's free and if it's over, you take off the 10 and charge the difference. The 2 employees assisting me would not at all follow this law even after mentioning that I was well aware of them having to follow our state law. This is the time when a security guard stood closer as to intimidate the situation until I stopped ""fighting for my rights."" 2 different price tags on the item was priced at 0.00. 15 dollars is what they told me it was going to stay at so I could either buy it for that price or not at all and that it wasn't up to them to uphold any law so I could call the cops if it was such a law and bring them to court for it.

A lot of the clothes are cute, too, and I always find myself discovering a new cleaning or cooking product that becomes indispensable. My only hesitation is that I am aware that Target shows their employees a lot of anti-union content to discourage the retail employees from unionizing and I don't really like that and I have discomfort about spending money with an union-busting retailer.",1," May 4, 2021","Chicago, Illinois",Chicago, Illinois

I ordered items at the drive up and when I got there I realized I had no room in my trunk for the items so I asked the rep if they can kindly put it in the front seat since there was no room in the back. The rep got very agitated. Opened the door. Put the items in and slammed the door shut and stormed off. Extremely uncalled for and very rude.

54,"The Target in St. John, Indiana is not consistent on enforcing their mask policy. I've have seen so many people with either no mask or a mask on their chin. No one says anything to them and they are left alone to shop. My husband went to visit the store to grab milk and was asked to leave if he didn't wear a mask. He has no problem wearing a mask, but was very surprised they asked him to leave. He even called me and said, ""I thought you said the mask mandate is not followed here at this store, that no one is wearing them."" I told him that's true. I visit that store twice a week and wish I took pictures of the amount of people not wearing a mask, mostly women. I've only seen one man with no mask.

In the Order Detail on my account, it said it's non-refundable. It took a phone call and a nice customer service person to refund me the money charged for the plan.

To start off, it's ridiculous that they have no hubs but send each item you order individually from random places and charge you as each items ships, so you end up with several charges instead of one. I had a package (totaling $11.98) stolen and instead of contacting UPS like I requested, the first Target rep said I'd get a full refund for the two items in that box, and quoted the above dollar amount. However, I was refunded only $8.07. After talking to a different rep and a ""manager"", neither of whom could explain why I was not being refunded the full amount and just kept telling me I didn't pay what I know I paid and didn't grasp that it wasn't supposed to be a refund but a way of them avoiding doing the work of contacting UPS, and who cares if it screwed their customer, I hung up on them and figured out how the money was divided between the orders when I logged onto PayPal.",1," Dec. 25, 2016","Portland, OR",Portland, OR

I go back to return it stupidly without a receipt about a month later having gone out of town. 38 days later without a receipt does not match Target’s return policy.

At first, these labs were for internal use only, but now they routinely offer assistance to federal, state, and local law enforcement authorities. This, most likely, is intended to be well meaning in the communities you serve. However, a privacy and civil rights issue occurs when an individual, through no fault of their own, becomes a person of interest to law enforcement authorities, and Target, through your close alliance with law enforcement, shares private information about an individual with your employees and they in turn go on to single out and intimidate these individuals upon entrance into your stores (without due process of the law). I have been a law-abiding citizen my entire life and, like anyone else, want to live in and create safe communities but when a store behaves as a vigilante, we all need to be fearful.

I called their website customer service to ask how to cancel/return the item and was told that all I had to do was write ""return to sender"" across the unopened package and when they get it back, they would credit my account what I paid.

Not only did they not let me cancel my offer, but they also said they would not give me the discount.

Other times, I was not because the customer service dept. said that they don't have to give you the Scanner's Law money if a price tag is not on the item. This is inaccurate and illegal. I called the Consumer Protection Division of the Michigan Attorney General and I was told that the law states they don't have to put a price tag on every item in the store.

Most of their items are cheaper online or in their app and to get the price in store you literally have to scan each item then show the cashier the lower price. I’m happy to say they will honor it but how many people take the time to scan each item to show? Imagine how much change and dollars consumers lose when they don’t.

Lately, due to a bank error, our checking account was frozen for a few days. The error had been resolved and everything is up and running. Due to this, there were a handful of Red Card transactions that were denied. When we learned of this, we quickly resolved the bank error and called Target to pay the returned charges. Target would not waive our $60 in fees, even though we've been loyal customers. Found that odd but decided to eat it, maybe our bank would reimburse us for that later.",5," Feb. 5, 2020","Fresno, CA",Fresno, CA

1046,"Target is a respected store with a return policy that is easy to follow. If my nearest Target store does not offer what I want to purchase, they usually provide info where the product is available.

1047,"Store, products and prices are all good in Target. Where all retailers and big box stores need to improve is on the quality of their staff.

There's isn't always the widest range of products or prices, but you can find nearly every household good under one roof and the quality and value are consistent.

1051,"Nearest store only a mile away. I don’t know if adding groceries was a great idea. I guess they have to compete with the others who also offer them. Remodeling during that time period was inconvenient for shoppers, because lot of items had to be moved to other spots in the store. Nice BIG store now.",5," Feb. 5, 2020","Tucson, AZ",Tucson, AZ
1052,"I go to Target to buy extra Tidy Cat (35-lb bucket) litter and Purina dry Cat Chow when they put it on sale for Buy-2-and get $5 gift card. The cards usually get rolled over into more purchases when it's a tight money week. Tidy Cat comes in yellow buckets, w/different colored lids, depending on the ""type"" (all acts the same). All of which are usually on sale at the same time. Often stores only have a lot of one type. This time I went on Monday and bought 4 buckets - blue lids, since they had a lot more of them and were higher on shelf and easier to lift into the basket. I get to the register but they don't come up as the sale. Clerk tells me, ""Oh the ad says ""select"", so it's only the red lid ones shown in the photo."" Then why did I get the sale price on Purina Naturals, when the only dry food bag photo was the regular type?",5," Jan. 30, 2020","Lindenhurst, NY",Lindenhurst, NY
1053,"Do NOT ever order from target.com. They steal your money and don't give it back very quickly, they are very less than helpful. They won't send anything to your bank to allow you get your money back any faster. Watch out for these SCAM ARTISTS. If I could give them zero stars I would.",5," Jan. 23, 2020","Yelm, WA",Yelm, WA
1054,The product listed did not provide in the write-up that is was a digital e-mail purchase. Thinking it was a disk that would be shipped - placed order. After that it showed it was a digital e-mail receipt for download. It then said contact quickly if you have any changes to your order. Order was still in process; took some time to figure out how to get a real voice at Target. When I contacted them saying I wanted to cancel - they said they could not do that on an electronic download purchase (which I hadn't received at that time).,5," Jan. 19, 2020","Mineral Bluff, GA",Mineral Bluff, GA
1055,"I ordered a lot of items during the holidays, my mental health was not in a good place so leaving the house was hard. I unfortunately had a lot of missing packages or items from orders, which is not my fault since I never delivered the packages nor packed them. Well Target has taken to blaming me for other's faults and has taken away my ability to place online orders or take advantage of order pickup and drive up. I have reached out multiple times and on multiple social media sites but have gotten the same canned response and then nothing after that. I have an infant at home that I had to drag crying and sick into the store because I was not able to place a pickup or drive up for items. My husband is in the Navy and works 12+ hour days and I have zero family in the area.",5," Jan. 12, 2020","Virginia Beach, VA",Virginia Beach, VA
