0,I I bought two pillowcase bed sham from Bed Bath & Beyond. When I took the them out of the package has the colors are slightly off. I tried to return one of them just for a simple exchange to try to get to that simply matched. The manager of the store is incompetent idiot - Burlington Massachusetts. Don't waste your time going there if you have any problems whatsoever and a lot of their products are just plain crap. Thank you.,1," Jan. 8, 2022","Newton, MA",Newton, MA,Bed Bath and Beyond
1,"They cancelled my Christmas order so my gift never arrived. No explanation given. Spent 20 minutes on phone with customer service, who committed to calling me back after finding out why the manager cancelled my order. Never heard anything. They have no customer service and they do not value the business of their customers. In doing this review, discovered there are many, many complaints. I choose not to give my money to disrespectful companies that could care less about doing their jobs and addressing customer concerns.",1," Jan. 4, 2022","Penn Valley, CA",Penn Valley, CA,Bed Bath and Beyond
2,"When I placed a order for a electric blanket on 12-19-21 my only shipping option was standard ground. On 12-20 BBB notified FedEx that my package was ready to pick up. On 12-23 FedEx finally picked up my package in Texas and I was given a delivery date of 12-26. Well... on 12-27 FedEx finally left Texas with my package and on its way to GJ Colorado. On 12-28 I was notified of a scan in Henderson CO and then finally received a new delivery date.... on 01-04-22!!! BBB really needs to give customers more shipping options and they need to find a better shipping company than FedEx, like UPS, DSL and USPS!",1," Dec. 28, 2021","Fruita, CO",Fruita, CO,Bed Bath and Beyond
3,Two orders did not arrive…although their customer service said that they were delivered. Three hours to contact customer service..and then was promised delivery. Still not received. I was promised same day delivery. Should say: NO DAY DELIVERY. They have my money. I have no product. The thought of trying to contact customer service again is a hopeless thought. I really do not know how to have anyone solve this. How can a business be run like this with no concern for the customer whatsoever. They make it as difficult as possible to reach customer service. I can't even ask for a refund since I cannot get the products delivered. Money and hours wasted!! Shame on BBB!! Never put faith in BBB to come through honestly.,1," Dec. 20, 2021","Larkspur, CA",Larkspur, CA,Bed Bath and Beyond

I can not reach them to even give them the case # to have my money refunded. I have called over & over, used the virtual chat, called the location it came from, and nothing.

5,"I order and shop in store a TON. I started doing same day delivery a few months ago. A few weeks ago ordered OXO containers, they came scratched from being just thrown in the bag. Last week ordered a Ninja knife set and when it was dropped off the box was not sealed and only the knife block was in the box. I’ve contacted Bed Bath and Beyond over 4 times about this with zero resolution. Told 2-3 days and still nothing. I offered to return the block with a label. I was told to either drop it off at the store or discard the block. Also, I’ve requested a receipt from a few months ago to make a return and still no receipt.

7,"I have experienced this problem multiple times with Bed Bath & Beyond, and have expressed my frustration to them each time -- but nothing changes. When I return an item, I expect my refund in 1 - 2 days. Every other retailer -- Walmart, Target, CVS, Home Depot, etc. -- refunds my money back into my bank or onto my credit card in 1 - 2 days. Not BB&B. Three to five days, or even longer. They have their item back AND they still have my money. This is not standard practice for the industry.

8,"Bed Bath & Beyond has delayed my shipping twice. When I spoke with the customer representative for the first time, it was suggested the best way to get my order on the day I need was to cancel my current order and place a new one to pick it up at a store near me. I placed a new order to pick it up at a store; however, my original order was never canceled. I received a second email saying my original order is being delayed. I called Bed Bath & Beyond which the representative says this time the order can only be canceled after 30 minutes of placing it. It is unacceptable that a store the size of Bed Bath & Beyond does not have a better system in place. If my item has never been shipped it should be an easy fix for them to do.

Well, I purchased a set of Oxo bowls which were featured in their catalog. When I took them out of the box, they were much too heavy for me. Put them right back in the box, taped it up and my son took to the UPS/FedEx store for immediate return -- UNUSED. Their policy is refund to the original method of payment, which is my BB&B charge account. Lo and behold, I received a merchandise gift card for $68 in the mail from them.

No vacuum outside. No package outside. I asked my neighbour if they received a package and they said no way. They would have given it to me. They know my name. I called Bed Bath and Beyond and they gave me the run around and said, ""Go ask your neighbours."" I did. I also sent emails asking for a signature or a picture of the package outside the door they delivered it to. Guess what? Because of Covid they have neither!!! I am out $200 and a vacuum. I work retail also and we do not treat customers this way at all. Thanks for nothing bed bath and beyond. I will never ever go into the store again.

Today on 8/20 I get a notification ""Unfortunately we're not able to fulfill part of your order"" and they canceled my order. This is really annoying as I was expecting these glasses for a party.

Two days later, it still showed that it had not been sent to a carrier so I called them. They told me it was out of stock and they would refund my money. Why in the world would they tell me something shipped when they didn't actually have it in stock? That's unethical and should be illegal. It seems like every time I try to orders something, I get an out of stock when I go to checkout.

The latest possible time of arrival was suppose to be the 26th (today). My order has not even been sent out yet as of today. I do a chat with them to see what is the issue. Their excuse was their shipper is having issues and is backed up. So you knew this as a company but yet still allowed me to order without any warnings. Nor did you reach out just as basic humans to inform me they are having shipping issues. They just took my money and basically did not care if I get my order or not... Their attitude was nonchalant. So I asked, ""Why can’t you just set me up to pick up my items at my local store."" Their reply was they can not change an order delivery method once it has been complete.

No communication from BBB related to case, I have an Instant Pot I don’t need as I bought a new one from Target on Xmas Eve.

Also, my breath was taken away in a bad way due to the over perfume smell walking in the door. I gagged in my face mask. Nonetheless, I needed the item I came in for. Before I get around the corner of the odd lay out of the store, there was a woman not wearing a face mask. There is a mandate in Shelby county that states businesses must require customers to wear facemask. Which shows that this company does not follow county mandates. When walking around the store there were several pairs of employees just standing around chatting, and I seen the employees look at this customer not wearing a mask, but did not say anything to her.

The overall CSR's within this retail, fully care more for myself, while additionally including overall feedback in what I would like.

433,I placed my order online and realized I had made a mistake in my email address because I did not get a confirmation that I placed my order. I called the next day and got Quanesha on the phone and boy was I glad that I did. I told her what I had done and she fixed it. I also told her that if you sign up for the emails that you would get 20% off one of the items that you purchased. Quanesha looked after this as well. I see some people have not been happy with the service. I guess I am lucky or you just need to ask questions to make sure you get what you need. I would recommend Bed Bath & Beyond to other people for sure!!! Thank you so much Quanesha for the excellent customer service!!!,5," Jan. 12, 2020","Toronto, ON",Toronto, ON,Bed Bath and Beyond
434,"I recently went to the stores in Charlottesville and Waynesboro Virginia. I order from their website occasionally but had forgotten how wonderful the in-store experience is at Bed Bath. I was given all of the help I need to get my college student's room ready at the Charlottesville store and as I drove home I thought about a KitchenAid attachment that I thought about buying but did not. I was driving past the Waynesboro store so I pulled in. They did not have the attachment that I had wanted in stock. When I mentioned out loud, I wish I had bought in in Charlottesville, Margo the sales associate immediately said, ""Let's write it up and I will have it shipped to your home at no charge."" This was on Sunday and on Tuesday it was on my porch. Great company with great products and employees!",5," Nov. 24, 2019","Charlottesville, VA",Charlottesville, VA,Bed Bath and Beyond

In the meantime we had a family emergency and probably 2 months had lapsed before I could do anything about it. I took it to the closest Bed, Bath, and Beyond but found out they did not carry it in the store. To my surprise and delight, they cheerfully reordered it online for me, making sure I got the same sale price, discounts and free shipping I had the first time.

Whilst shopping, I saw one of those above-the-bed space saver shelves, and decided to purchase it. However, the box was poorly taped together (apparently it had been damaged in the shipping process) and I was afraid to carry it around the store while I finished my shopping. I had this brief vision of the box falling apart and spilling pieces all over the narrow walkways of the store. So, I had it kept behind the register so that didn't happen.",5," Aug. 17, 2017","Bethlehem, PA",Bethlehem, PA,Bed Bath and Beyond

A year ago the store carried some basic linens, curious kitchen tools and some expensive items to buy with their 20% discount. Now, the store carries lots of upscale items, iRobot, Dyson, Wamsutta, Frette, fine china. I go there to learn new trends, and saw customers swapping coffee pods. There are no dead inventory lying on the shelves being unwanted. Their purchasing department stock shelves with top rated products. Their customers are smart shoppers looking for the best cost/value products. I have had good time there, asked for help while shopping and got lots of assistance. She walked me showing every each their luxury bedding, discussed colors choices, reviews and products maintenance.

450,"I normally do not write reviews but I had to for their customer service. They went above and beyond on what they needed to do. I placed an order and it was shipped to the wrong address. So I called and spoke to Joe from customer service. I told him the story and he told me since one of my order was shipped back that he was able to replace the item but the other two shipments, he couldn't since it was confirmed it was delivered. He would need to request the packaged be sent back before they can reissue. So here I'm thinking I will have to go to my old apartment and beg the current tenant to return my stuff and that all hope was lost. But then Joe called back and said that they are going to replace the items out of courtesy. They did not have to do that. I did not scream or shout demanding anything and I was willing to compromise.

They have stuff that are missing and they try to sell that too. I saw a Vornado fan that was used and I mean used. The fan blades had a lot of dust on it. It was for sure a return because they do sell their display models and it’s not half bad.
