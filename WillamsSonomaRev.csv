3,"The store does NOT put up notices nor do the sales associates inform that the food/candy is not returnable the time of purchase. When I tried to return the overpriced, unopened vanilla extract and 2 tins of the holiday candy (with receipt) I was informed by the sales associate that it was dangerous to take back food items and the store policy do not to accept returns on these items. When I asked where the sign stating that, she said it was on the receipt. That is bad policy and business practices as you only get a receipt AFTER purchasing item, making it immediately non-returnable.",1," Jan. 4, 2022","Oakland, CA",Oakland, CA,Williams Sonoma
4,I have loved this store for years and years. Over the last year or so I have been getting more and more disappointed. Ordered something a year ago that was not in stock and was backorder for a few months. Once that time came their warehouse canceled the order without calling us. When we called into support they said they reordered it. A month later when we did not get it still called again and was told that they were waiting on a call from us. WHAT???? Last item I ordered I received yesterday a beautiful ginger jar. It was on sale half off or a bit more. It was chipped and the jar lid was too small for the base opening. Called support to get a replacement and a return shipping package for the faulty product. Was told that due to it being on sale no refund or return. I want a product I paid for not a defective product. Don't think I will be ordering anything online from them again.,1," Dec. 30, 2021","Parsons, KS",Parsons, KS,Williams Sonoma
5,I purchased 2 mirrors in November 2021 and 4 light sconces for a brand new bathroom we were building. In December mirrors arrived but 1 was damaged- they advised me to send it back and issued me a replacement number and assured me the new mirror was being sent. Fast forward to December 23rd no mirror so I call to see where it is as the contractors have installed my other matching mirror - entire bathroom has been built around these mirrors and lights and I am told sorry no mirror was shipped or will be shipped as it is discontinued. ,1," Dec. 27, 2021","Mississauga, Other",Mississauga, Other,Williams Sonoma

I went online to check the tracking of the item and now it states an expected delivery date of 1/6-1/10... no email notification or any communication from WS. I called to cancel the item and literally got the runaround and was told I could not cancel the order because it was in ""backorder""...if it has not shipped then why can I not cancel it? My intent was to cancel and pick up at the local store but now I will wait and return it to the store but now I will include the Air Fryer I bought and the Griddle (total of $500 of purchases) and instead go to Sur La Table.

Was told by Ashanti they have an ETA of 12/22 to their distribution center in Ohio, and that they would not give me a refund or expedite shipping so there is zero chance I'll have them for my brunch the morning of 12/24. Why wasn't I informed there was a stock issue prior to 12/17? Why is this item still on the website with ""order by 12/21 for Christmas delivery"", when they haven't even fulfilled my order from 12/07? I noticed there are no item reviews on the website today.

I ordered an espresso advent calendar from WS (final sale) and was unhappy to find that the capsules do not work in my Nespresso machine as advertised. I have attempted to review this product twice in order to help others avoid the same ‘final sale’ mistake and both times my honest and measured review has been ‘moderated’ per WS. As they have not provided any others specifics, I am unsure as to why they will not my post review... but as there are no other reviews for this product, I have my suspicions.

Upon checking my Paypal/credit card notices there was NO REFUND. I contacted them via several emails, their online chat function, and several attempts to their customer service line which is a poor connection at best making it impossible to hear the customer service agent and I was also hung up on. On the 17th Nov my account was refunded in the amount of $16.95. Well short of my $100.75 full purchase amount.

Today (the last time), I was put on hold for 45 minutes, no music, no check in, nothing- and then the line disconnected. I have now sent an email to customer service @ Williams Sonoma. This is unfortunate as I have been a customer for 20 years and I am assuming the company is affected by the labor shortage, that said - there should be a process to elevate issues as I have to spend another $2-3k to have cushions made or throw the set away.",1," Oct. 26, 2021","Rye Beach, NH",Rye Beach, NH,Williams Sonoma

I contacted customer service and asked that they replace the plate once I had returned the chipped one. They informed me I had to return the set of 8 plates and they would then send me a new set or I could keep the plates as is and get a small refund (worth less than the value of a plate).

They are completely unapologetic for their mistakes, unaffected by the inconveniences they cause to your time and schedule, and they simply don't care to make your experience with dealing with them pleasant or even just courteous. Last time they had mistakenly sent my GC to someone else and it took them 6 months after a good 30+ hours on the phone with them over 20 phone calls to get them to give me the damn gift card that they had mistakenly sent to someone else. No apologies, no compensation for all the wasted time. Experiencing the same thing today with furniture. Wasted my time with confirmed scheduling of delivery which turned out to be a system glitch.

Don't know where the UPS box or drop off are or any reason other than to return this random pillowcase to go to a Williams Sonoma storefront.

I am a very educated woman, one with a doctoral degree and a strong presence in the community. Today, June 11, 2020 while visiting Williams Sonoma at the Biltmore Fashion Square in Phoenix, Arizona at around 4:35pm, I experienced abhorrent behavior from their assistant manager. I came to the store to buy the Breville Waffle Maker for my family. While browsing through the store for other home items, the assistant manager followed me very closely. I was interested in a throw for my home and wanted to feel the texture. While doing so, she ran up to me and alarmed me by screaming “DO NOT TOUCH THAT”. I turned and told her, “You are making me feel very uncomfortable with the way you’re treating me. I’m going to speak with your manager.""

I was looking at a round cake pan, when the large, heavy sheet pan and cooling rack on the shelf above came down and hit above my eye and cheekbone. It caused an abrasion and blurry vision. The associate witnessed it and did not ask if I was ok. Instead she told me a customer was playing with that pan last night and they must have not secured it correctly. I walked out and began feeling a massive headache and blurred vision. I called Amy in corporate who asked me to go back and fill out an incident report. I went back and met with the store manager who was extremely dismissive of the issue. She said the associate had asked if I was ok and I said yes. This is totally false!

I believe it was because the Spring merchandise was being moved out for the next season. The staff are only too eager to help you find what you need, and they are my first choice for all things kitchen and home decor!",5," Oct. 10, 2019","Bronx, NY",Bronx, NY,Williams Sonoma
472,Went from a 4 burner Char-Broil to this unit. It is considerably better built than the CharBroil as is all stainless steel. Only a 3 burner plus side burner but plenty adequate. It has a built-in thermometer in the hood but better to use actual meat thermometer for accurate temperatures of whatever you happen to be cooking.,5," June 19, 2019","Murphys, CA",Murphys, CA,Williams Sonoma
473,"Deshawn ** (driver) was ahead of schedule and made sure to call when he was on his way to confirm delivery. He was friendly, efficient, and ensured I was happy with the quality of the furniture, assembly, and support. I’ve never had better delivery/customer service! I was apprehensive about paying a delivery fee and having someone come in and assemble the furniture but it was well worth the fee!",5," Dec. 22, 2017","Lynn Haven, FL",Lynn Haven, FL,Williams Sonoma
474,"Purchased Magimix Robot-Coupe toaster. I love it, love it, love it. Best toaster I ever had. Well worth the money if you like your toast toasted right, English muffins come out perfect, raisin toast, scali bread, frozen toaster pastries. Once you know what number or level to set at, it's great. Some people say burns top, only happened 1st time then worked perfect. Love it, would highly recommend.",5," Jan. 22, 2016","Stoughton, MA",Stoughton, MA,Williams Sonoma
